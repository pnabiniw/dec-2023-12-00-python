# Boolean are immutable datatypes
# True and False are the boolean data types in Python
# True and False are also the keyword to represent boolean

# Operations that give boolean type
# 1. Comparison Operation (>, <, >=)
# 2. Logical Operation (and, or, not)
# 3. Membership Operation (in, not in)
# 4. Identity Operation (is, is not)


# Booleans are the sub-class of integers in python where True equals to 1
# and False equals to 0

result = True + True
print(result)  # 2

result = 50 * False
print(result)  # 0

# All the non-empty objects including True itself are the Truthy objects
